<p> When I try to uploaded file through upload_file.html, 
    but in real, the file is not getting uploaded , it is using writeToFilemethod to copy the contents of the fileuploaded file 
    to new loacation.  
     
     In writeToFile method we are using two parameters one is uploadinputstream and another is uploadStringLocation,
     in this method we are creating new file using uploadStringLocation,  
     then we are copying the contents of the file using out.write(bytes,0,read;)
